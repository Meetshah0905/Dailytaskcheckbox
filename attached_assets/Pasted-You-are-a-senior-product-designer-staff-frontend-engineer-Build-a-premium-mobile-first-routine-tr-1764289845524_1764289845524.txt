You are a senior product designer + staff frontend engineer. Build a premium mobile-first routine tracker web app with an interface inspired by the CRED credit-card app style: dark, minimal, luxury, smooth, and addictive to use daily. Do NOT copy CRED assets, icons, fonts, or exact screens. Create an original design that feels similar in vibe: premium dark UI, bold typography, clean cards, subtle gradients, crisp motion, and satisfying micro-interactions.

CORE PRODUCT
A routine tracker where:
- I have a default daily routine (preloaded on first launch)
- I can edit blocks/tasks anytime (times, order, names, must-do)
- I check tasks each day
- The app auto-saves offline
- It has a Snapchat-like streak system (streak kept if rules satisfied)
- It has calendar history + stats
- It feels effortless and beautiful on iPhone (Chrome/Safari)

PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)
- Mobile-first: perfect for 320–430px width.
- FULLY responsive up to tablet + desktop.
- No horizontal overflow anywhere.
- Touch targets >= 44x44px for primary actions.
- Add:
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
- Support iPhone safe areas:
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, labels, ARIA where needed, keyboard nav, visible focus rings, good contrast, supports prefers-reduced-motion.
- Performance: smooth 60fps scrolling; avoid heavy stacked shadows; keep animations subtle.

TECH STACK (IMPLEMENT FULLY)
Use: React + TypeScript + Vite (or Next.js if you prefer). Tailwind is OK, but keep it clean and token-driven. Do not add big UI libraries.
Offline-first storage: IndexedDB preferred (fallback to localStorage if needed).
Add PWA support if possible (manifest + service worker) so it can be “Add to Home Screen”.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (SCREENS)
Use a bottom navigation (CRED-like) with 4–5 tabs:
1) Today
2) Calendar
3) Edit Routine
4) Stats
5) Settings (optional; can be a sheet from Today)

TODAY SCREEN (FAST DAILY FLOW)
- Top: Today + date, subtle greeting text (optional), and a compact settings icon.
- Big Streak Card (hero):
  - 🔥 Current streak + Best streak
  - Status for today: “On track / At risk / Completed”
  - One-line guidance: “Complete must-dos to keep streak”
- Progress bar + % completed
- Routine blocks as premium collapsible cards (accordion):
  - Each block shows: name + time range + completion count (e.g., 3/6)
  - Expand reveals tasks as large tappable rows
- Task rows:
  - Large checkbox with satisfying toggle animation
  - Task title
  - Optional “Must-do” pill/badge
  - Long-press or swipe for quick actions (optional)
- Auto-expand the current time block (based on device time). If none matches, expand Morning block.
- Add a quick “Mark today done” celebration if streak conditions met (subtle, not childish)

EDIT ROUTINE (TEMPLATE EDITOR)
- Edit blocks:
  - name, start/end time
  - reorder blocks (drag & drop)
  - delete with confirmation sheet
- Edit tasks:
  - add/edit/delete
  - reorder tasks
  - toggle Must-do
- The editor must feel clean and not cluttered: use bottom sheets/modals for editing forms.
- Provide “Reset to default routine” option with confirmation.

CALENDAR / HISTORY
- Month grid with day states:
  - streak kept (completed)
  - partial
  - missed (streak broken)
  - freeze used (optional state)
- Tap a date => opens Day Detail sheet:
  - shows tasks with completion checks for that date
  - notes (optional)
  - allow editing log (but warn if it affects streak)

STATS
- 7-day and 30-day completion rate
- Total tasks completed
- Streak timeline (simple SVG line or bars, no heavy chart libs)
- “Most missed tasks” list

SETTINGS (LIGHTWEIGHT)
- Completion threshold slider (default 80%)
- Streak Freeze:
  - enable/disable
  - allowance: 1 per 7 days (if implemented)
- Theme: Dark default (light optional)
- Export/Import JSON backup
- Privacy note: data stays local unless user exports/imports

STREAK RULES (SNAPCHAT FEEL)
A day is “streak kept” if:
A) all Must-do tasks are completed
OR
B) overall completion >= threshold (default 80%)
Optional: Streak Freeze (1 per 7 days) can save one missed day. Show freeze availability clearly.
Streak is date-based (YYYY-MM-DD). Handle missed days correctly (no cheating with device time; just be consistent).

DATA MODEL (IMPLEMENT)
- routineTemplate:
  blocks[] {
    id, name, startTime, endTime, order,
    tasks[] { id, title, mustDo, order }
  }
- dailyLogs indexed by date:
  { completedTaskIds[], notes?, lastUpdated }
- streakState:
  { currentStreak, bestStreak, lastStreakDate, freezeLedger? }

UI/UX STYLE (CRED-LIKE VIBE, ORIGINAL EXECUTION)
Design language:
- Dark luxury background with subtle gradient noise (very faint)
- Cards: glassy panels / soft blur, thin borders, rounded corners
- Typography: big bold headings, clean readable body, strong hierarchy
- Spacing: consistent 8/12/16/24 scale
- Icons: simple, consistent stroke set (original)
- Animations: short, smooth, expensive-feeling
  - 120–180ms for taps
  - 200–280ms for sheet transitions
  - Respect prefers-reduced-motion

Interaction patterns:
- Bottom sheets for editing and confirmations
- Swipe/drag affordances subtle
- “Today” feels like a dashboard; edit screens feel utilitarian but still premium
- Completion toggle has a satisfying “snap” animation + subtle glow
- Streak kept triggers a tiny celebration (micro confetti or glow ripple) once per day max

DESIGN TOKENS (CREATE)
Implement CSS variables or a TS theme file:
- colors: bg, panel, panel2, text, muted, border, accent, success, warning, danger
- radii: sm/md/lg
- shadows: minimal (avoid heavy)
- typography scale with clamp()
- spacing scale

DELIVERABLES
1) Complete working code (no pseudocode).
2) Clean folder structure + reusable components.
3) A short explanation of:
   - mobile layout choices
   - streak logic
   - storage approach
4) QA checklist for iPhone Chrome/Safari:
   - no overflow
   - safe area padding
   - large tap targets
   - offline persistence
   - smooth animations
   - accessibility + reduced motion

IMPORTANT
- Do not ask follow-up questions. Make reasonable assumptions and build it end-to-end.
- Keep it simple and addictive. Daily use must be 10/10.
